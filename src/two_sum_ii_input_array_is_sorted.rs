/*
* Given an array of integers `numbers` that is already *sorted in non-decreasing
* order*, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.
*
* Return* the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array
* *`answer`* of size *`2`*, where *`1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length`.
*
* The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may
* not use the same element twice.
*
*
* Example 1:
*
* Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
* Output: [1,2]
* Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
*
* Example 2:
*
* Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
* Output: [1,3]
*
* Example 3:
*
* Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
* Output: [1,2]
*
*
* Constraints:
*
* * `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
* * `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
* * `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
* * `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
* * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
